some "challenge" although it seems more likely a company attempting to solicit free work from applicants through oddly specific requirements. I didn't mention it in the comments but this was my main concern and why I didn't actually imrpove it as the comments suggest could be, but if you're reading this it's likely you can come up with faster solutions anyway, or implement the suggested improvements.

Whatever the case is, I've yet to receive any explanation for this exercise after more than two months, so I'm putting it up.
