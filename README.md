This is some "challenge" I was asked to complete for some job application I did a few months ago. This completes the "challenge" part at a minimum. Companies that solicit free work through applicants do exist, afterall.

To be clear - this solution is intentionally slower than it could be. I've left some comments explaining how this could be _signifigantly_ sped up if for some reason that will help you.

Whatever the case is I've yet to receive any explanation for this exercise after more than three months so I'm putting it up. Hope it helps someone.


# usage

just run `make run` to build and run or `make build` to build to the /bin directory.
